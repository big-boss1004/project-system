### Roadmap

The first release of the project system ("15.0") was heavily focused on supporting .NET Core scenarios and parity with [VS 2015 project.json tooling](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-project-system/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3AParity-XProj%20). This will continue through the Visual Studio 15.x.x updates and releases. In 16.0, we'll start focusing on [feature parity](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-project-system/labels/Parity-VSLangProj) with the legacy project systems in csproj.dll and msvbprj.dll, where the aim will be to allow a seamless open of existing projects with zero conversions or upgrades.
