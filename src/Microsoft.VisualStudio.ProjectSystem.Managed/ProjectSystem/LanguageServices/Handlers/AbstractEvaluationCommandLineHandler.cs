    {
        // This class is not thread-safe, and the assumption is that the caller will mkaes sure that evaluations and design-time builds do 
        // overlap inside the class at the same time.
        //
        // In the ideal world, we would simply wait for a design-time build to get the command-line arguments that would have been passed
        // to Csc/Vbc and push these onto Roslyn. This is exactly what the legacy project system did; when a user added or removed a file
        // or changed the project, it performed a blocking wait on the design-time build before returning control to the user. In CPS,
        // however, design-time builds are not UI blocking, so control can be returned to the user before Roslyn has been told about the 
        // file. This leads to the user observable behavior where the source file for a period of time lives in the "Misc" project and is 
        // without "project" IntelliSense. To counteract that, we push changes both in design-time builds *and* during evaluations, which 
        // gives the user results a lot faster than if we just pushed during design-time builds only.
        //
        // Typically, adds and removes of files found at evaluation time are also found during a design-time build, with the later also 
        // including generated files. This forces us to remember what files we've already sent to Roslyn to avoid sending duplicate adds
        // or removes of the same file. Due to design-time builds being significantly slower than evaluations, there are also times where 
        // many evaluations have occured by the time a design-time build based on a past version of the ConfiguredProject has completed.
        // This can lead to conflicts.
        //
        // A conflict occurs when evaluation or design-time build adds a item that the other removed, or vice versa. 
        // 
        //  Examples of conflicts include:
        //
        //   - A user removes a item before a design-time build that contains the addition of that item has finished
        //   - A user adds a item before a design-time build that contains the removoal of that item has finished
        //   - A user adds a item that was previously generated by a target (but stopped generating it)
        //   - A user removes a item and in the same version it starts getting generated via a target during design-time build
        //
        //  Examples of changes that are not conflicts include:
        // 
        //   - A user adds a item and it appears as an addition in both evaluation and design-time build (the item is always added)
        //   - A user removes a item and it appears as removal in both evaluation and design-time build  (the item is always removed)
        //   - A target during design-time build generates an item that did not appear during evaluation (the item is always added)
        //   - A target, new since the last design-time build, removes a item that appeared during evaluation (the item is always removed)
        //
        // TODO: These are also not conflicts, but we're currently handling differently to a normal build, which we should fix:
        //
        //    - A target, since the very first design-time build, removed a item that appeared during evaluation (currently the item gets added).
        //          * This is because a design-time build IProjectChangeDescription is only a diff between itself and the previous build, 
        //            not between itself and evaluation, which means that design-time build diff never knows that the item was removed.
        //
        // Algorithm for resolving conflicts is as follows:
        //
        // 1. Walk every evaluation since the last design-time build, discarding those from conflict resolution that have a version less 
        //    than or equal to the current design-time build. 
        // 2. Walk every design-time build addition, if there's an associated removal in a later evaluation - we throw away the addition
        // 3. Walk every design-time build removal, if there's an associated addition in a later evaluation - we throw away the removal
        //
        // We don't resolve conflicts between changes items, because the design-time build doesn't produce them due to the way we represent
        // command-line arguments as individual item includes, such as <CscCommandLineArguments Include="/reference:Foo.dll"/>, without any 
        // metadata.
