    <!-- Split the build parts out from the BuildNumber which is given to us by MicroBuild in the format of yyyymmdd.nn
         where BuildNumberFiveDigitDateStamp is mmmdd (such as 60615) and BuildNumberBuildOfTheDay is nn (which represents the nth build
         started that day). So the first build of the day, 20160615.1, will produce something similar to BuildNumberFiveDigitDateStamp: 60615,
         BuildNumberBuildOfTheDayPadded: 01;and the 12th build of the day, 20160615.12, will produce BuildNumberFiveDigitDateStamp: 60615, BuildNumberBuildOfTheDay: 12

         Additionally, in order ensure the value fits in the 16-bit PE header fields, we will only take the last five digits of the BuildNumber, so
         in the case of 20160615, we will set BuildNumberFiveDigitDateStamp to 60615. Unfortunately for releases in 2017 we can't go any higher, so
         we will continue the month counting instead: the build after 61231 is 61301. -->
